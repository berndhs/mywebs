Interactive Shell Service ¶

Project developers can access an Interactive Shell if they have been granted shell access for the project. The Interactive Shell provides a command line interface that can be used to manage the following:

    * Project web content
    * Developer web content
    * Project uploads
    * CVS repositories 

Features ¶

The Interactive Shell supports the following features:

    * SSH shell access to project content; access to data for other users and projects not provided
    * Comprehensive set to command line tools
    * 4 hour shell life - shells are automatically terminated after 4 hours.
    * Password or SSH keys authentication
    * CVS repository administration 

The Interactive Shell does not support the following features:

    * Cron service
    * File management service 

Management ¶

Project members must be granted shell access by a project administrator. Project administrators can grant shell access to project members from the project site:

    * https://sourceforge.net/projects/PROJECT 

via the:

    * Admin > Members interface 

Access ¶

Interactive Shell sessions persist for 4 hours once created. Authorized developers that have been granted shell access for a project can create/connect to an Interactive Shell with:

ssh -t USER,PROJECT@shell.sourceforge.net create

NOTE: Be sure to substitute your SourceForge.net login username for USER, and the respective SourceForge.net project UNIX name for PROJECT.

If you do not have an active Interactive Shell session a help page can be viewed with:

ssh USER@shell.sourceforge.net
