Mobile Outdoor User Interface
=============================

This will be the home of *MOUI*, the Mobile Outdoor User Interface.

The http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/moui/index.php?title=Main_Page[wiki is here].

There is the sf.net http://sourceforge.net/projects/moui/[summary page].

In-Vehicle Infotainment systems in cars and airplanes are made to
distract passengers from the duration of travel. 

In boating, the travel is the entertainment.

Consequently, systems for boating should aim to improve the quality
of travel, rather than keeping the passengers quiet until it's over.

== Plans ==

Currently this work is in the planning stage. Some things depend on outside
developments, so plans can change.

- The UI will be developed on top of MeeGo. Failing that, on Fedora.
- The initial versions will be derived from the MeeGo Tablet UX.
